# Minesweeper-in-C

## Game created in C as a 1st semester university group project for the CS1002 Programming Fundamentals course.

The game is a version of the classic Minesweeper and runs on the console. It is written entirely in **C** and incorporates programming concepts learned during the course.

### Team Members and their Contributions:

* **@AbdulRahman9075** (ME) :  Created the function that takes user defined dimensions and total mines as parameters to generate a minesweeper board with mines generated at unique random positions and calculates values based on how many cells each mine touches and created the functions to reveal the surroundings of a random cell at the start of the game and ‘selected cell’ after every move(hint).
  
* **@Sadiq-Amin** : Wrote the code for user input that takes coordinates as input from the user and reveals the specified cell and provides the appropriate output for gameplay for player-game interaction and checking if the game is won or lost.
  
* **Pawan** : Created functions to calculate mines and generate the score in the game, which updates with each move, using the parameters such as the ratio of mines and numbered cells.

### Usage Instructions:

* Download all files and use the `minesweeper.c` file to run the game.
